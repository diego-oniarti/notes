\section{Innovation}
\subsection{Novelty vs Innovation}
Innovation is the \textbf{implemetation} of a new or significantly improved product, or process, a new markeitng method, or a new organizational metho in business practise, worplace organizaiton or external relations. \\
Innovation = invention + exploitation \\
An innovation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item there is a market need
    \item has a strong value proposition
    \item solves a problem
    \item does the job better than other
    \item there are custoners willing to pay
    \item it is technologically feasable
    \item it is financially sustainable
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why do we need innovation?}
Bisinesses \textbf{must} innovate to keep up with the competition. The benefit to the customer is a byproduct of the race between the companies. \\
For the business, innovation is a necessity to survive
\begin{itemize}
    \item to survive competition in the short and long term
    \item to acquire market share
    \item to look for premium price, better margins, higher added value
    \item innovation is the \textbf{real} protection of your IPRs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Kinds of innovation}
Innovation can be a \textbf{process}, a \textbf{prduct}, or an entire \textbf{business model}. 
The only thing that matters is that it is \textbf{NEW}.

\subsection{Radical vs Incrementa innovation}
\paragraph{Incremental}
We call an innovation "\textit{incremental}" when it improves on something that already exists. \\
It lives in a short cycle, with recurrent improvements on an existing solution.

It's a reliable investment for the companies because it relies on mainstream customers in major markets.

\paragraph{Radical}
Radical innovation is the departure from existing tecnologies and solutions to offer something \textbf{entirely} new.
Radical innovations are those innovations that bring to a market a very different value proposition that hadn't been aviable previously,

\subsection{Theory of disruptive innovation}
In his book "disruptive innovations", Christenses presents "the innovator's \\ dilemma". This dilemma is the one between investing in a possibly risky innovation and playing it safe.

One of the risks in NOT investing in a disruptive technology is that of a competitor investing in it and stealing potential market shares.

\section{Types of problems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Latent problems:} Customers have a problem but the don't know it. \\
        Esempi: \begin{itemize}
            \item Spotify / music streaming
            \item Smart voice assistants
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Passive problems:} Customers know they have a problem but are not motivated or aware of the opportunity to change
    \item \textbf{Urgent problems:} Customers recognize a problem and are searching for a solution
\end{itemize}

\section{My Idea}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Who: Music enthusiasts with short attention spans
    \item Problem (a latent one): Someone suggests a song to you but you forget the title, or to listen to it
    \item Solution: An app where your friends can leave you song suggestions, and you see them as a playlist
\end{itemize}

\section{Lean}
In the lean methodology the assumpion is that its possible to figure out the \textbf{unknowns} of a business in advance, before you raise money and actually execute the idea.

\subsection{Principle 1}
Rather than engaging in months of planning and research, entrepreneurs/intrapreneurs accept that all they have on day one is a series of untested hypotheses.

\paragraph{How do we test these hypothesis?}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item State your hypothesis \\
        L'ipotesi deve essere \textbf{specifica} e avere uno scope limitato
    \item Design experiment \\
        L'esperimento deve essere semplice e di tipo binario (pass/fail)
    \item Test \\
        Il test deve involgere l'utente
    \item Insignt
\end{enumerate}
